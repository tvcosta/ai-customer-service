"""Grounding service for determining if LLM responses are grounded in KB content.

This service implements the core business rule: answers must be grounded in knowledge base
content, otherwise return 'unknown' status.
"""

from __future__ import annotations

# TODO: Implement in Phase 2
# - GroundingService with decide_grounding method
# - Logic to evaluate if answer is supported by retrieved chunks
# - Confidence scoring for grounding decisions
# - Pure domain logic with zero framework dependencies
